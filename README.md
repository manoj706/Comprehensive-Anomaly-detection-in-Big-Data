# DBSCAN and K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** and **K-Means Clustering** for clustering datasets. DBSCAN is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to identify clusters of varying shapes and detect outliers, while K-Means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into a predefined number of clusters.

## File Description
- **DBscan.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of DBSCAN and K-Means clustering using `scikit-learn`. It includes:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature selection
  - Normalization
  - Applying the DBSCAN algorithm
  - Applying the K-Means algorithm
  - Visualizing clustering results
  - Comparing DBSCAN and K-Means clustering performance

## Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   (https://github.com/manoj706/Comprehensive-Anomaly-detection-in-Big-Data)
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/Code.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to see the clustering results for both DBSCAN and K-Means.

## Dataset
Ensure that the dataset used in the notebook (CSV file) is available in the same directory or modify the path accordingly within the notebook.

## Visualization
The notebook includes scatter plots to visualize the clustered data, where each cluster is represented with a different color. Additionally, it provides a comparative analysis of DBSCAN and K-Means clustering results.
